# DisPATCh

DISPATCH is a disaggregation algorithm of the low-resolution soil moisture (SM) estimates derived from passive microwave observations. It provides disaggregated remote sensing SM data at low resolution by using the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimated from optical/thermal remote sensing data.
